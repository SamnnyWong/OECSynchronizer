		I am a 3rd year Computer Science Specialist student at the University of Toronto with a passion in software and web design. Through my dedication in my studies, I have established high proficiency in developing, testing, and debugging software in various programming languages including Python, Java, and C. I have experience with test-driven and object-oriented development, as well as many development strategies and testing methodologies through course and personal projects. My two years of co-op work experience has given me deep exposure and familiarity with Agile environments, and real word practice in quality assurance testing and development work, particularly in Powershell, SQL, and C#. I love learning new things, and enjoy investing my time to expand my knowledge and expertise in any way. I find myself frequently on Youtube watching different videos and tutorials, picking up new skills and knowledge. In that respect, I also like to travel and spend time with friends and family.

		Hi, I am a 3rd year student in Computer Science Specialist Program with primary focus on software engineering stream. Over the years, Iâ€™ve become proficient in programming and scripting language such as Java, Python, C, C#, VBA, and shell, and tools like Eclipse, Android SDK, IntelliJ, SQL server and Visual Studio. In addition to my academic achievements, I have worked as a programmer analyst in a manufacturer company in need of updating obsolete database management system where I enhanced programming skills and communication skills. Also, as a business analyst at CIBC, I worked at capitals market risk management department where we analyze, test, and reconcile during the conversion of legacy system to new system. I have gained confidence to work with a team and strengthened my problem-solving and organizing skills. I love to keep myself up-to-date with technology through websites like Engadget or TED. In my spare time I like to jam with my band, swim, and play volleyball.

		I am a third year student in UTSC major in computer science. C# is my first programming language and over the years I have learned python, java, php, C, html and SQL. I have once built several small project on my own with jQuery and javascript. I am familiar with JSON Server construction and fully experienced in android application development. Programming within diverse environments makes me an experienced programmer. Also, i am very interested in the development of bitcoin, automatic drive and VR.
		<br>
		I think the project of C01 will gives me a better understanding towards a full cycle of app/web development, and I am looking forward to see what the result will be.

		I am Tian Xia, a 3rd year student in the Software Engineering Specialist program at the University of Toronto Scarborough. After entering the university, I realized my passion for computer science. Driven by this passion, I have done some personal and team projects involving web service, computer graphics and AI, and have become proficient in programming languages such as Python, C, C++, C# and Java. Last year, I started an 1-year internship to develop, test and benchmark the back end of a web-based collaboration environment. These experiences helped me gain an in-depth understanding of software development, software design and computer architecture. In my spare time, I enjoy playing various video games, listening to music and experimenting with technologies in areas such as graphics and procedural generation.

		I actually spent most of my childhood prepping to study Engineering at University but after taking the first year Intro to programming course, I felt Computer Science was the right program for me. I've found that my passion for creating has transfered over to the digital world via the means of computers, and thus, here I am, going into fourth year as a budding Computer Science specialist at UofT. 
        Throughout my time here, I've been able to experience, and gain insight on the niches of my field through the various courses and co-op opportunities presented to me. I have blossmed into an ethusiastic programmer and information security researcher with 2 years of professional experience. Some of my programming languages of choice include, C#, Java, Python and C.
