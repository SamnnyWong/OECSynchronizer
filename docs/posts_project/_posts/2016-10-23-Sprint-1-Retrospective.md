title: Sprint 1 Retrospective

### Our progress
At the end of our deliverable 2, we had made our personas and corresponding user stories. Through our interview with the TA and the beginning our plan for deliverable 3, we soon realized a few of our user stories were epics. We had to break them down into smaller requirements and provide more details to clarify vague terms. We chose our top 2 priority user stories to implement for our first sprint. Our product designers Steven and Sam produced an UML diagram of our application, and based on this, we implemented modules from our UML to satisfy our user stories.


### Our plan turnout
During the planning of our sprint, we planned to complete 5 user stories and 3 major modules of our design. Unfortunately, we underestimated our project velocity and overlooked our individual schedules of midterms and other commitments. Halfway into the sprint week, we had meeting to replan and scaled down our sprint goals down to 2 stories. This new plan was more realistic, and we successfully completed the sprint and completed the 2 user stories.


**Estimated project velocity**: 63

**Actual project velocity**: 63
