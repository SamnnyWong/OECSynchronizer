title: Sprint 2-4 Retrospective
---

### Our progress
At the end of our deliverable 3 (sprint 1), we had a full UML design, and implemented the ability to fetch and compare data from NASA to OEC. From there, we progressed to implementing other modules from our design that are related and no longer blocked by the modules we have completed. This includes extending our fetch and data compare to support exoplanet.eu, submitting pull requests to GitHub of the results of our data compare, and updating our user interface with options to utilize these new features.

### Our plan turnout
From deliverable 3, we only had one sprint on reading week and we were able to follow and achieve what we had planned for that sprint. But even though our initial planning method was successful, we knew we had to take into account our midterm schedules, and our responsibilities from other courses for the upcoming weeks. As a result, for our sprint 2, we had projected a lower project velocity to adjust to our change in availability. However, we still overestimated, and had to extend a few tasks into our next sprint to be completed. This time, for our sprint 3, we were more strict on estimating our availability and we sub-divided our tasks into smaller, more singular work so that a task can be finished sooner and would be more flexible to add into our personal schedules. This plan turned out well, and so we used the same procedure in planning our sprint 4, which we also completed successfully and had achieved our estimated project velocity.

**Estimated project velocity (over 3 sprints)**: 105

**Actual project velocity (over 3 sprints)**: 86
