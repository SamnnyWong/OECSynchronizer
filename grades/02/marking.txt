CSCC01 Deliverable 2 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Total: 81/100

Personas:  15 / 20

  Format: 3 / 4

      must contain: gender, age, personality, skills, environment,
      attitude towards technology in general, attitude towards
      computer software, goals when using the system

      Too many irrelevant details are not useful!

==== Comments ====
- The professional context is missing from every personas. Where are they working? Are they from the same lab? (-1)
==================

  Information content:  4 / 8

      The purpose of each persona is clear. Personas suggest different
      system requirements.

==== Comments ====
- The personas do not address the goals when using the system (-2)
- Their aptitudes towards software is vague in general (-2)
==================

  Coverage: 8 / 8

      personas must include at least two of the following type of users:

      -- "Hanno type"

      -- Hanno's grad student: can approve modifications to the data,
           but cannot add other such users (only Hanno can)

      -- A less tech-savvy astronomer: Sure, Hanno is the client who
           makes the order, but the software will be released as
           open-source, so other types of users are 100% realistic.

==== Comments ====
- good
==================

Product Backlog:  38 / 50

    8 / 10 : User stories follow the format
                "As __name__ (__role__), I want __something__."
		("so that __benefit__" is optional)
	       AND each __name__ corresponds to one of the personas.

    5 / 10 : User stories, together, reflect all the user
    	        requirements (from all prospective users).

    8 / 10 : User stories correspond to actual requirements (no
    	        "invented" features).

    5 / 10 : User stories contain enough information for devs to
                estimate how long it would take to implement it.

    5 / 10 : Each user story addresses one specific requirement (no
                "world peace" stories).

==== Comments ====
- Does not follow "As __name__ (__role__) ..." but "As __role__ ..." instead (-2). This is important as you will have to add that information later during planning.

- Some user stories seem artificial (-2). For instance, get notifications through SMS (-2)

- Many user stories mentions doing things through Github directly. Therefore, it is not clear whether these tasks are part of the software. This needs to be clarified. (-3)

- Many user stories are vague (-5) and makes it it difficult to implement (-5). For instance, you should define what is an "update" and precise what your mean by "some user interface".

==================

Presentation:  19 / 20

  4 / 4 : well-presented, is easy to read and to navigate

  4 / 4 : spelling and grammar

  10 / 10 : looks professional

  1 / 2 : quality of the README file

==== Comments ====
README should be more explicit about what the deliverables contain (-1)
===================

Interview: 9 / 10

==== Comments =====

1) The process [2]:

Satisfying although there should be a lot more face-to-face meeting at this earlier stage of the project
- 3 meeting (1 after meeting with the client)
- TA feedback

2) Personas [2]:

Considered two personas doing the same tasks, same privileges but different aptitudes towards technology.

Satisfying however the team should not stop at what the client wants but rather understand what the client needs.

3) Product Backlog [2]:

Satisfying.

4) Details of User Stories [2]:

Not fully satisfying. The answer remained vague despite being asked to precise it (-1)

5) Sprint Backlog [2]:

Satisfying.
